## Dumping and Cracking Hashes on Windows

**\*\*\*Dumping Hashes check - system and host base attacks**

**Tools to dum hashes:**

\-Meterpretr “hashdump” command

\-Mimikatz

**Tools to crack the hashes**:

\-John the Ripper

\-Hashcat

_\*SAM Database. The Windows stores hashed passwords in Security Accounts Manager_ (SAM) database. Files from SAM cannot be copied while OS is running. To dump hashes from LSASS process we can use in-memory techniques, and administrator privileges are required. The SAM database is encrypted with a syskey in modern versions of Windows. If Repair Utility was used before, a copy of the SAM Database was made.

\*Authentication and verification of user credentials is done by Local Security Authority(LSA)

\*Windows uses NTLM hashes from Vista onwards. NTLM uses MD4 hashing algorithm.
