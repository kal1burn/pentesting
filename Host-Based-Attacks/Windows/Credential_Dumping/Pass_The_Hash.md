## Pass the Hash Attack

> *   Pass-the-hash is an exploitation technique that involves capturing or harvesting  
>     NTLM hashes or clear-text passwords and utilizing them to authenticate with  
>     the target legitimately.
> *   Tools to use:
>     *   Metasploit PsExec module
>     *   Crackmapexec
> *   This technique will allow us to obtain access to the target system via legitimate  
>     credentials as opposed to obtaining access via service exploitation.

After we have dumped the hashes from the target system, save them into a text file with this format:

```plaintext
Administrator: afe04867ec7a3845145579a95f72eca7
```

### Using Crackmapexec

```plaintext
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.10 -u Administrator -H “afe04867ec7a3845145579a95f72eca7”
-x "whoami"
```
