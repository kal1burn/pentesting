### DNS Zone Transfers

DNS is a protocol used to resolve domain names to ip addresses.

The DNS server is provided by your ISP, but you can change it on your router or on your OS.

> Local DNS Records are located on /etc/hosts on linux and C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts on Windows.

#### **DNS Records**

> \-A Resolves hostnames or domains to an IPV4 address
> 
> \-AAAA Resolves hostnames or domains to an IPV6 address
> 
> \-NS Reference to the domain nameserver
> 
> \-MX Reslove a domain to a mail server
> 
> \-CNAME Used for omain aliases
> 
> \-TXT Text Record
> 
> \-HINFO Host Information
> 
> \-SOA Domain Authority
> 
> \-SRV Service Records
> 
> \-PTR Resolves IP addresses to a hostname

### HOST DISCOVERY

### Host Discovery with Nmap (using ICMP)

show your ip

```plaintext
ip a
<10.0.2.15/24>
```

nmap ping scan in the subnet

```plaintext
sudo nmap -sn 10.0.2.0/24
```

### Host Discovery with Netdiscover (using ARP Requests)

```plaintext
sudo netdiscover -i eth0 -r 10.0.2.0/24
```

---

### PORT SCANNING

### Port scanning with Nmap

scanning windows system with ping scan disabled. Windows will block ICMP requests.

```plaintext
nmap -Pn 10.0.2.15
```

> \-p- Â scans the entire tcp port range
> 
> \-p 80,445 scans for specific ports
> 
> \-p 1-1000 scan a range of ports
> 
> \-F scans for 100 of commonly used ports
> 
> \-sU scan for UDP ports
> 
> \-v display output during the scan
> 
> \-sV service version detection scan.
> 
> \-O OS detection scan.Not too accurate
> 
> \-sC script scan default
> 
> \-A aggresive scan. Combines -sV -O -sC
> 
> \-T4 time scan. a higher number will speed up the scan. The range is from 0 to 5. T0 and T1 are for IDS evasion. T2 uses low bandwidth, T3 is the default. T5 can produce DOS.
> 
> \- oN mynmapscan.txt. Saves the scan in mynmapscan.txt file.
> 
> \-oX mynmapscan.xml. Saves the scan in xml format.
