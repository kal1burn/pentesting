# **SMB Enumeration (139, 145)**
Port 139 is used by SMB dialects that communicate over NetBIOS. It operates as an application layer network protocol for device communication in Windows operating systems over a network. For example, printers and serials ports communicate via Port 139.

Port 445 is used by newer versions of SMB (after Windows 2000) on top of a TCP stack, allowing SMB to communicate over the Internet. This also means you can use IP addresses in order to use SMB like file sharing.
